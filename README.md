# SEO_linkAnalyzer
An internal link counter using Node.js.

## Usage
To run the crawler clone the directory
```
git clone https://github.com/Conor-Fleming/SEO_linkAnalyzer/
```

Navigate to the source directory:
```
cd SEO_linkAnalyzer
```
And run ```npm run start <url>```
(this is temporary instructions till I set up dependencies etc)

The program should output each link that is being searched and a report of the link and the count of occurances in the site at completion.

Thanks for looking!
